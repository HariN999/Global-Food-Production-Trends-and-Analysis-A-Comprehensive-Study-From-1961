# 🌾 Global Food Production Trends and Analysis (1961–2023)

## 📘 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes global food production trends from 1961 to 2023. It provides insights into the production of key crops and fruits, highlighting trends by year and by country. The interactive dashboards allow users to explore the data and understand historical patterns in global food production.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze global trends for major crops (rice, wheat, maize, tea, coffee, fruits).
- Visualize production by year and by country/entity.
- Identify patterns and fluctuations in crop production over time.
- Provide interactive dashboards to support decision-making and research.

## 📊 Key Activities & Visualizations
1. **Sum of Rice Production (tonnes)** 
2. **Sum of Wheat Production (tonnes)** 
3. **Sum of Tea Production (tonnes)** 
4. **Sum of Coffee, Green Production (tonnes) by Entity** 
5. **Sum of Wheat, Maize, and Rice Production (tonnes) by Year**
6. **Sum of Apples, Avocados, Bananas, and Oranges Production (tonnes) by Entity** 
7. **Sum of Maize Production (tonnes) by Year**
8. **Sum of Grapes, Apples, Bananas, and Oranges Production (tonnes)**
